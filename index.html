<b>Multiple Positions for PhD with Funding!</b>
I am actively looking for motivated students with strong background in any (or several) of mathematics (optimization, linear algebra, matrix analysis, etc.), computer programming, machine (or deep) learning, and computer architecture to join our newly established research group at DASS Lab for a PhD. If you are enthusiastic about research in topics related to machine learning, parallel and distributed computing, and computer systems for efficient edge computing, and deeply interested in building a research group as a founding member, please consider submitting <a href="https://uarizona.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9MKtBjblpyNvr1A" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><b>Research Interest Form</b></a>.
<!-- 
send me an email with subject line <i>"Prospective student from [insert your university/organization] applying for PhD starting [choose Spring'25 or Fall'25]"</i> with your current CV.
--> 

To complete the formal application, you would also need to apply to either of the PhD programs offered in the ECE Department at the University of Arizona - Computer Science and Engineering (<a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/admissions-guides/#program/CSEPHDDIR" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Direct</a> or <a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/admissions-guides/#program/CSEPHDPOST" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Post-MS</a>) or Electrical and Computer Engineering (<a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/admissions-guides/#program/ECEPHD" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Direct or Post-MS</a>). The department processes graduate applications throughout the year. TA and scholarships for the Fall semester are determined by the pool of Fall applicants who apply by December 15. Our lab also warmly welcomes highly motivated M.S. students and undergraduates at UofA to explore research opportunities with us. Students from underrepresented communities in STEM are encouraged to apply.

<h2>Biography</h2>

Jyotikrishna Dass is an assistant professor in the <a href="https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Arizona</a>. His research integrates machine learning, parallel computing, and hardware design to create efficient algorithms and systems for distributed edge intelligence. His work has been featured in the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS), IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), IEEE Micro and IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC). He has served as instructor-of-record for several courses during his graduate studies and is eager to contribute to the department's new <a href="https://engineering.arizona.edu/majors/computerscience" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> computer science and engineering program</a>.
<br /><br />
Prior to joining U of A, Dr. Dass was a research scientist and executive director at Rice University, leading the <a href="https://d2k.rice.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Center for Transforming Data to Knowledge (D2K)</a>. From 2021-2022, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Rice, co-writing grant proposals for NSF Core Programs ($1.2 million), META Network for AI ($50K), and Rice University Creative Ventures Fund ($10K).
<br /><br />
Dr. Dass earned his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2021. His research was recognized with the <b>Best PhD Dissertation Poster Award</b> at the Annual Computing Conference, 2019 among fourteen SEC universities. He was also a <b>College of Engineering Graduate Teaching Fellow</b> in 2020 and received the <b>CSE Teaching Assistant Excellence Award</b> in 2018. He holds a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication engineering with a Minor in CSE from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati.

<!-- 
I am currently a Research Scientist in <a href="https://d2k.rice.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> The Rice University Centre for Transforming Data to Knowledge (Rice D2K Lab)</a>. My research broadly focuses on integrating ideas from machine learning, parallel and distributed computing, and hardware design to develop algorithms and architecture for distributed edge, and federated machine learning. As a member of the leadership team at D2K, I am responsible for leading the development of D2K policies and procedures. I also build relationships with industrial, healthcare, and community partners for D2K capstone program. In addition, I oversee the management of administrative functions in the center and direct the day-to-day financial, research and academic administration.
<br /><br />
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Rice University. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring which involves sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with students. At Texas A&amp;M, I had been appointed as <b>Graduate Assistant Lecturer</b> in Fall 2018 and Fall 2020 and was awarded <b>Graduate Teaching Fellowship</b> in Spring 2020. I am also the recipient of the <b>Teaching Assistant Excellence Award</b> in Spring 2018. Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor of Technology program from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Guwahati) majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.
