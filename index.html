COMMENT: <p>I joined the Rice University Data to Knowledge (Rice D2K) Lab as a Research Scientist starting August 2022</p> 
</div></div>
-->
<h2>Biography</h2>

I am currently a Research Scientist in <a href="https://d2k.rice.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> The Rice University Centre for Transforming Data to Knowledge (Rice D2K Lab)</a>. My research broadly focuses on integrating ideas from machine learning, parallel and distributed computing, and hardware design to develop algorithms and architecture for distributed edge, and federated machine learning. As a member of the leadership team at D2K, I am responsible for leading the development of D2K policies and procedures. I also build relationships with industrial, healthcare, and community partners for D2K capstone program. In addition, I oversee the management of administrative functions in the center and direct the day-to-day financial, research and academic administration.
<br /><br />
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Rice University. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring which involves sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with students. At Texas A&amp;M, I had been appointed as <b>Graduate Assistant Lecturer</b> in Fall 2018 and Fall 2020 and was awarded <b>Graduate Teaching Fellowship</b> in Spring 2020. I am also the recipient of the <b>Teaching Assistant Excellence Award</b> in Spring 2018. Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor of Technology program from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Guwahati) majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.
