A square is a flat shape, in one plane, defined by four points at the four corners. A square has four sides all of equal length, and four corners, all right angles (90 degree angles). A square is a kind of rectangle.\n","\n","**Hint**:- Datatype conversion (casting) is required in order to calculate the area and perimeter. \n","\n","![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Yj5_nYBjXdwaOBx6nOU1551uPOxJ-4SI)\n","\n","### Perimeter of square = 4 x side\n","### Area of Square = side x side\n","\n","The desired output should be as follows **with 2 decimal places for every blank**:\n","\n","\n","```\n","Perimeter of square with side ______ cm is ________ cm\n","Area of square with side ______ cm is ________ square cm\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DbMfQPpMqLHT","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zcbjy6HLqwgJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exponential operator (**)\n","Write a program to calculate the following for a user-input value for *side* using ** operator\n","\n","*   Area of a Square \n","*   Volume of a Cube\n","\n","The desired output should be as follows **with 2 decimal places for every blank**:\n","\n","\n","```\n"," Area of square with side ______ cm is ________ square cm\n"," Volume of cube with side ______ cm is ________ cubic cm\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"nh4B_EOgrEFB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
